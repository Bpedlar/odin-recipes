<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon espresso powder (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 egg whites, beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and espresso powder together in a bowl; beat in egg whites. Stir flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Mix flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is combined. Spread batter as thin as a slice of American cheese onto the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until batter is nearly cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven; cut a shallow square pattern into the batter with a sharp knife. Place back into the oven; bake until batter is crisp, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely; break into squares.</li>
